Review
----------------------------------------
	During the process of fixing up this html and css document, I definently could have spent more time on this and given enough it would have turned out much better.
	
	
Challanges
----------------------------------------
		I had a lot of troubles. It was easy to spot the first couple troubles, such as the Search engin optimization link not working and the images not having an alt element.
		The main thing I was trying to do was make the website work properly and fix any html code make it look prettier.


Conclusion
